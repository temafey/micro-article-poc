  # TracerMiddleware services removed - tracing is now handled by
  # OpenTelemetryCommandMiddleware in config/packages/observability.yaml
  # which provides OpenTelemetry semantic conventions for command bus tracing.

  # Note: Command buses (tactician.commandbus.command.identity and tactician.commandbus.query.identity)
  # are configured in config/packages/tactician.yaml using the Tactician Bundle.
  # Handlers are tagged in layer_application.yaml with 'tactician.handler' tags.
